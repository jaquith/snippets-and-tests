# snippets-and-tests
This is a lightweight framework to help unit test vanilla JS by transforming them into a Nodejs export.

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Then you can run the tests in the `unit-tests/active` folder with `npm test`.  

The helper functions and included examples should let you easily test your own vanilla JS snippets as well.
